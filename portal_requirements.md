## Reporting Page
**Purpose:** Provide clients with downloadable monthly reports. Allow historical access without asking manually.

**Layout:**
- Month-by-Month Report Cards (Grid layout, one card per month)
  - Each Card Contains:
    - Report Month
    - PDF/Link to Download the Monthly Report
    - Overview Data:
      - Links built
      - Budget spent
      - Key target pages used
      - Separate cost breakdown by location (if relevant)
- Pricing Table Link (Lightly hidden but accessible)
  - So clients can understand link pricing tiers based on DR/DA if needed.

---

## Approvals Page
**Purpose:** Let clients approve or reject link targets and website opportunities. Reduce confusion about costs and process.

**Layout:**
- Table View: Website Opportunities & Link Targets
  - Columns:
    - Domain
    - DR/DA
    - Estimated Traffic
    - Price (cost associated with that opportunity)
    - Client Notes (optional input)
    - Approval Status (Approve / Reject button)
    - Notes from Client (optional text field)
- Special Field:
  - Instruction Note: "If you reject a website, please leave a reason (e.g., not a good fit, poor design, etc.). This helps us improve future opportunities."
  
**Logic:**
- If a website is rejected â†’ Reason field becomes mandatory.
- Approved websites automatically move into the deliverables queue for next month's builds.
- Clarification Note: "Websites not used this month may be used in the following month if still relevant."
